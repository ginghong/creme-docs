## What is a Pie?

A Pie is a personal, narrative-driven index — a structured, on-chain portfolio aligned to your goals and convictions.

## How is this different from a trading bot?

Crème reinforces reasoning and structure. You set intent, rules, and reviews; we help you stay aligned. No hype-chasing automation.

## Is this a fund or vault?

No. Pies are self-custodial and composable. You own the assets; nothing is pooled.

## How to rebalance my portfolio?
Currently, you can rebalance the portfolio through re-execute your plan in the curation page. 

In the near future, the auto-rebalance will be implemented.

## How the portfolio is curated/how the tokens are choosed?
its curated by our agent with in-house algorithm, it will consider several factors, including mindshare, trends, sentiment, etc 

But keep in mind, Crème doesn’t offer any kind of financial advice.
