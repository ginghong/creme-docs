# Getting Started with Crème AI

This page explains how people typically begin using Crème AI, and how the core ideas fit together.

It is not a setup guide or tutorial.  
It is meant to help you understand how the product works in practice.

---

## Starting with an idea

Most people begin with an idea rather than a transaction.

This might be:

-   A theme they care about
-   A question about their exposure
-   A way of organising existing assets

Crème AI refers to these as **narratives**.

Narratives are not predictions.  
They are a way to frame thinking and organise context.

---

## Creating a personal index

Ideas become **personal indexes**, called pies.

A pie is defined by the user.  
It reflects how they want to group assets around an idea.

At this stage:

-   A pie can exist without affecting assets
-   Nothing is bought, sold, or moved
-   The pie is simply a structure

Crème AI does not manage pies.  
They are not shared products or strategies.

---

## Exploring and learning

Users can explore existing pies and ideas created by others.

This is meant for:

-   Learning how others structure ideas
-   Comparing different approaches
-   Gaining context

Exploring is informational only.

Crème AI does not treat other pies as recommendations, and users should not assume suitability for their own situation.

---

## The role of AI

As users explore and refine ideas, AI helps organise information.

It may:

-   Summarise context
-   Highlight relationships
-   Assist with understanding unfamiliar concepts

The AI does not:

-   Choose assets
-   Rebalance portfolios
-   Trigger changes

AI output is supportive, not directive.

---

## Executing a pie

A pie only affects assets when a user chooses to apply it.

When applied:

-   Changes are proposed based on the pie’s structure
-   The user reviews the changes
-   The user explicitly approves the on-chain action

Crème AI does not hold funds or execute trades on its own.

If a user does not approve an action, nothing happens.

---

## Making changes over time

Personal indexes are not static.

Users may:

-   Adjust ideas
-   Change allocations
-   Apply updates when their thinking changes

Each update requires:

-   Deliberate user action
-   Explicit approval

Crème AI does not rebalance or adjust portfolios automatically.

The user remains responsible for decisions at every stage.
