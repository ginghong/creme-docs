## What is Crème'ai?

Crème'ai helps retail investors stay meaningfully exposed to crypto long-term without being consumed by it — turning chaos into calm, curated portfolios.

## Our Story

Crème was founded to solve a simple frustration:

crypto investing is chaotic.

Retail investors either juggle spreadsheets or chase hype.

We saw the need for calm structure - a simpler way to invest with conviction for the long run.

## Market Context

Retail investors underperform traditional benchmarks by over 5 % yearly — a gap widened in crypto by volatility and information overload.

Existing solutions fall short:

-   **Bundles** (e.g. Kraken) are centralised and off-chain.
-   **Vaults** (Reserve, Enzyme) are rigid and institutional like.
-   **Portfolio apps** (Glider) assume users already know what to buy.

## Contrarian Stance on AI

Most “AI agents” in crypto automate trades or replicate hype.

Crème adapts a collaborative workflow architecture.

It reasons with users, clarifies strategy, and structures long-term portfolios.

**We see AI as a transparent partner, not a black box.**
